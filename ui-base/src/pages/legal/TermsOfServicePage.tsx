                These Terms govern your use of Byteful (the "Service"). By creating an account or using Byteful, you agree to these Terms.

                You may create a Byteful account using your email and password, or by signing in with Google OAuth. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account. To send email campaigns, you must link Byteful to a valid Google account. You agree that you are the rightful owner of that account and have the right to grant Byteful the requested permissions. You agree not to share your account credentials or OAuth tokens with others.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                You are solely responsible for all content you send through Byteful. This includes the text and recipients of your email campaigns. You agree to use the Service only for lawful, legitimate purposes. You must comply with all applicable laws regarding electronic communications, including laws about privacy and unsolicited emails.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                For example, you must ensure your campaigns include proper unsubscribe instructions and valid physical address, as required by the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act and similar laws. You must not upload or send any content that is illegal, fraudulent, harassing, defamatory, or infringing on others' rights. Byteful does not screen your content before sending. If any dispute arises with a recipient or authority about your emails, you agree to indemnify and hold Byteful harmless from any resulting claims, damages or costs.

              </div>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                Byteful strictly prohibits unsolicited bulk email (spam) and any abusive use of the Service. If you purchase or use email lists, you bear the risk if those addresses have not opted-in. You must promptly honor any opt-out (unsubscribe) requests from recipients.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                For example, compliance with CAN-SPAM requires that all commercial email have accurate header information, a valid physical address, and a clear unsubscribe method. Violation of anti-spam laws or our policies may result in suspension of your account. Byteful does not monitor outgoing emails, but Google may take action on Gmail accounts that appear to send spam: Google itself warns that "User accounts that send spam might be permanently restricted from sending email". Byteful is not responsible for such Gmail enforcement actions.

              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                All fees are non-refundable: as one example terms state, "All service fees are non-refundable; no refunds or credits for partial months of this Subscription". You remain responsible for all charges incurred until your account is cancelled. If payment fails or subscription lapses, we may suspend your account until payment is received.

                We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, with or without notice, for any reason (including violations of these Terms). For example, one service's policy states: "We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate your account … at any time with or without notice or refund".
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                You acknowledge that using an online service involves inherent risks. For example, as one policy notes, "no security system is impenetrable". Byteful does not guarantee that emails will be delivered or arrive on time, since delivery depends on Gmail's systems and your recipients' email providers. Byteful explicitly disclaims any liability for Gmail sending limits or failures. Byteful also does not guarantee the performance of any third-party integrations or services.

                In particular, Byteful is not responsible for any issue caused by third-party systems: "We are not responsible for the transmission or reception of information by any Third Party Products. … If any changes in Service cause Third Party Products to become obsolete or affect their performance, you are responsible for addressing those issues". Similarly, "in no event shall we be liable for any damages related to any third party product or service" (for example, Gmail itself).
